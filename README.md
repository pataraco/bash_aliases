# bash_aliases
copy of my bash_aliases file with all my aliases and functions that make my job easier
WTH - including some other . files too!

## Description
I'm constantly creating and using bash functions to make my job easier.
Some of the functions are site specific, but can be referenced for your own use.

## Usage
Just place in your home directory, it should be source by your .bashrc file

### "Show Aliases" and "Show Functions"
Here are some useful aliases:
* a  - list aliases
* f  - list functions
* sa - show alias
* sf - show function

## Have Fun!
hope someone picks up some tricks from these!

-Later!
